# top-rock-paper-scissors
A simple implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game in Javascript played entirely in the console. The game is played between a human and a computer, and the first to get 5 points is declared the winner.

`getComputerChoice` generates random number between 0 and 2 to simulate the computer's choice.

`playRound` simulates a round of the game, determining the result based on the choices made.

`getResultMessage` generates a message based on the outcome of the round.

`declareWinner` prints the name of the winner.
